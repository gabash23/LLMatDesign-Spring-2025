The modification of Sr2Ti2O6 to Sr2TiZnO6 was not successful in achieving the target band gap value of 1.4 eV, as the band gap increased from 1.85 eV to 2.60 eV instead, indicating that the substitution of titanium with zinc led to a less favorable electronic structure for reducing the band gap.
The modification from Sr2TiZnO6 to BaSrTiZnO6 was only partially successful, as the band gap decreased from 2.60 eV to 2.53 eV, falling short of the target value of 1.4 eV; this indicates that while the substitution of strontium with barium had a slight effect on the electronic structure, it was insufficient to achieve the desired reduction in band gap.
The modification of BaSrTiZnO6 to BaSrTiZnO5, while resulting in an increase in the band gap from 2.53 eV to 2.70 eV, was ultimately unsuccessful in achieving the target band gap value of 1.4 eV, indicating that the removal of an oxygen atom did not have the desired effect on the electronic structure as hypothesized.
The modification from BaSrTiZnO5 to CaSrTiZnO5 was partially successful, as the band gap decreased from 2.70 eV to 2.65 eV; however, it fell short of the target band gap of 1.4 eV, indicating that further adjustments or additional substitutions may be necessary to achieve the desired electronic properties.
The modification from CaSrTiZnO5 to PbSrTiZnO5 was only partially successful, as the band gap decreased from 2.65 eV to 2.57 eV, falling short of the target value of 1.4 eV; this indicates that while the substitution of calcium with lead did lead to a slight reduction in the band gap, it was insufficient to achieve the desired electronic properties, suggesting that further modifications or alternative strategies may be necessary to reach the target band gap.
The modification of PbSrTiZnO5 to PbSrTiZnO4 was partially successful, as the band gap decreased from 2.57 eV to 2.31 eV; however, it did not achieve the target value of 1.4 eV, indicating that further adjustments or alternative strategies may be necessary to significantly lower the band gap.
The modification from PbSrTiZnO4 to SnSrTiZnO4 successfully reduced the band gap from 2.31 eV to 1.90 eV, demonstrating a significant shift towards our target of 1.4 eV; however, while the substitution of Pb with Sn effectively lowered the band gap, further adjustments or additional substitutions may be necessary to reach the desired value.
The modification of SnSrTiZnO4 to SnSrTiZnO3S was successful in significantly reducing the band gap from 1.90 eV to 1.32 eV, effectively achieving our target of 1.4 eV, as the substitution of oxygen with sulfur successfully altered the electronic structure and lowered the energy levels, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hypothesis.
